So, every element is related to itself.</li>\n<br/><li>Symmetry : For all $x, y$ in $R$, if $y - x$ is an integer, then $x - y = - (y - x)$ is also an integer. So, if $x$ is related to $y$, then $y$ is related to $x$.</li>\n<br/><li>Transitivity : For all $x, y, z$ in $R$, if $y - x$ and $z - y$ are integers, then $(z - y) + (y - x) = z - x$ is also an integer. So, if $x$ is related to $y$ and $y$ is related to $z$, then $x$ is related to $z$.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, $A$ is an equivalence relation on $R$.</p>\n<p><b>Statement II :</b> $ B={(x, y) \\in R \\times R: x=\\alpha y}$ for some rational number $\\alpha$.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reflexivity : For all $x$ in $R$, $x = 1x$.

Since the product of rational numbers is rational, if $x$ is related to $y$ and $y$ is related to $z$, then $x$ is related to $z$.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, $B$ is not an equivalence relation on $R$ since it does not satisfy the symmetry property.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the correct answer is <br/><br/><b>Option B :</b> Statement I is true, Statement II is false.</p>\n"

However, among these, there are people who read both newspapers A and B, given as 8. To find the number of people who read only newspaper A, we subtract the number of people who read both from the total number of people who read A. That is,</p>\n<p>n(A only) = 25 \u2013 8 = 17</p>\n<p>Similarly, the number of people who read only newspaper B is calculated as :</p>\n<p>n(B only) = 20 \u2013 8 = 12</p>\n<p>Now, we are given the percentage of each of these groups that look into the advertisements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>30% of those who read A but not B,</li>\n<li>40% of those who read B but not A,</li>\n<li>50% of those who read both A and B.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find the total percentage of the population that looks into advertisements, we add up the contributions from each of these groups. We calculate each group's contribution by multiplying the size of the group by the percentage of that group that looks at advertisements :</p>\n<p>= $${{30} \\over {100}} \\times 17$$ (from A only) + $${{40} \\over {100}} \\times 12 $$(from B only) + $${{50} \\over {100}} \\times 8 $$(from both A and B)</p>\n<p>= 5.1 (from A only) + 4.8 (from B only) + 4 (from both A and B)</p>\n<p>Adding these up, we get</p>\n<p>= 13.9</p>\n<p>This means that 13.9% of the total population looks into the advertisements.</p>\n<p>So, the correct answer is :</p>\n<p>Option D : 13.9.</p>\n"

The cardinality of $A$ (the number of elements in $A$), denoted as $n(A)$, can be computed as the greatest integer less than or equal to $140/2$. Hence, $n(A) = \\left[\\frac{140}{2}\\right] = 70$. ([.] denotes greatest integer function)\n\n<br/><br/>2. Similarly, let $B$ be the set of students whose number is divisible by 3. Hence, $n(B) = \\left[\\frac{140}{3}\\right] = 46$. ([.] denotes greatest integer function)\n\n<br/><br/>3. Let $C$ be the set of students whose number is divisible by 5. Hence, $n(C) = \\left[\\frac{140}{5}\\right] = 28$.\n\n<br/><br/>So far, we've found the number of students who opted for Mathematics ($n(A)$), Physics ($n(B)$), and Chemistry ($n(C)$).\n\n<br/><br/>We also need to consider the students who have opted for multiple subjects :\n\n<br/><br/>1. $n(A \\cap B)$ represents the count of numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., divisible by 6). \n<br/><br/>So, $n(A \\cap B) = \\left[\\frac{140}{6}\\right] = 23$.\n\n<br/><br/>2. $n(B \\cap C)$ represents the count of numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15). \n<br/><br/>So, $n(B \\cap C) = \\left[\\frac{140}{15}\\right] = 9$.\n\n<br/><br/>3. $n(C \\cap A)$ represents the count of numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10). \n<br/><br/>So, $n(C \\cap A) = \\left[\\frac{140}{10}\\right] = 14$.\n\n<br/><br/>Finally, $n(A \\cap B \\cap C)$ represents the count of numbers that are divisible by 2, 3, and 5 (i.e., divisible by 30). \n<br/><br/>So, $n(A \\cap B \\cap C) = \\left[\\frac{140}{30}\\right] = 4$.\n\n<br/><br/>Now we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to compute the number of students who have opted for at least one subject. The principle states :\n\n<br/><br/>$$n(A \\cup B \\cup C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) - n(A \\cap B) - n(B \\cap C) - n(C \\cap A) + n(A \\cap B \\cap C)$$\n\n<br/><br/>Substituting the values we calculated above :\n\n<br/><br/>$$n(A \\cup B \\cup C) = (70+46+28) - (23+9+14) + 4 = 102$$\n\n<br/><br/>Hence, the number of students who opted for at least one subject is 102. Therefore, the number of students who did not opt for any of the subjects is <br><br>Total $$-$$ n(A $$ \\cup $$ B $$ \\cup $$ C)\n<br><br>=  140 $$-$$ 102 = 38"

                            "explanation": "In this problem, we're dealing with 3-digit numbers in set $A$, and subsets $B$ and $C$ which represent numbers of specific forms.\n\n<br/><br/>1. First, we consider the numbers of the form $9k + 2$ (Set $B$) within the 3-digit range, which starts at 101 and ends at 992.\n\n<br/><br/>2. We calculate the sum of these numbers, denoted as $s_1$. To calculate $s_1$, you use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series : \n\n <br/><br/>   $$(n/2) \\times (\\text{{first term}} + \\text{{last term}})$$ \n\n <br/><br/>  Here, $n$ is the total count of such numbers. These are 3-digit numbers of the form $9k + 2$, and we can find the total count by subtracting the smallest such number (101) from the largest (992), dividing the result by 9 (because we're considering numbers with a difference of 9), and then adding 1.\n\n  <br/><br/> The sum $s_1$ is calculated as follows :\n\n <br/><br/>  $$(100/2) \\times (101 + 992) = 54650$$\n\n<br/><br/>3. According to the problem, the sum of all elements of the set $A \\cap (B \\cup C)$ is $274 \\times 400 = 109600$. \n\n <br/><br/>  Since the set $A \\cap (B \\cup C)$ is the union of two disjoint sets (the set of all three-digit numbers of form $9k + 2$ and the set of all three-digit numbers of form $9k + l$), we can write this sum as :\n\n<br/><br/>   $$s_1 $$(for numbers of the form  9k + 2) + $$s_2$$  (for numbers of the form  9k + l) = 109600\n\n<br/><br/>4. Solving this equation for $s_2$ (the sum of numbers of the form $9k + l$), we get :\n\n <br/><br/>  $$s_2 = 109600 - s_1 = 109600 - 54650 = 54950$$\n\n<br/><br/>5. The sum $s_2$ can be expressed as $(n/2) \\times (\\text{{first term}} + \\text{{last term}})$, where $n$ is the count of numbers of the form $9k + l$. The first term here is the smallest 3-digit number of this form, which is $99 + l$, and the last term is the largest such number, which is $990 + l$.\n\n <br/><br/>  We equate this to $s_2$ to solve for $l$ :\n\n<br/><br/>   $$54950 = (100/2)[(99 + l) + (990 + l)]$$\n\n<br/><br/>6. Simplifying this equation, we get :\n\n <br/><br/>  $$2l + 1089 = 1099$$\n\n <br/><br/>  Solving for $l$, we find :\n\n <br/><br/>  $$l = 5$$\n\n<br/><br/>So, the correct answer is 5."

So in our case, we need to find how many $n$ satisfy the equation $3^n - 3 = 7k$ for some integer $k$.\n\n<br/><br/>Notice that $3^n - 3 = 3(3^{n-1} - 1)$. We want this expression to be a multiple of 7. Let's explore a few powers of 3 modulo 7:\n\n<br/><br/>$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^4 \\equiv 81 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^5 \\equiv 243 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^6 \\equiv 729 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>We observe that $3^n \\pmod{7}$ follows a cycle of length 6. So, $3^{n-1} \\pmod{7}$ also follows the same cycle, but shifted:\n\n<br/><br/>$3^0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^3 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>$3^5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$\n<br/><br/>We want $3(3^{n-1} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$, which means that $3^{n-1} - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. From the cycle above, we see that this is true when $n-1$ is a multiple of 6, or equivalently, when $n$ is one more than a multiple of 6.\n\n<br/><br/>Now let's find the multiples of 6 between 10 and 100:\n\n<br/><br/>$12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96$\n\n<br/><br/>Adding 1 to each of these values, we get the set of natural numbers $n$ that satisfy the given condition:\n\n<br/><br/>$13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79, 85, 91, 97$\n\n<br/><br/>There are 15 elements in this set. Therefore, the number of elements in the given set is $\\boxed{15}$."

That is, $$(a, a) \\in R$$ for all $$a \\in S$$.</p>\n\n<p>A relation is <strong>transitive</strong> if whenever $$(a, b) \\in R$$ and $$(b, c) \\in R$$, then it must also be the case that $$(a, c) \\in R$$.</p>\n\n<p>A relation is <strong>symmetric</strong> if whenever $$(a, b) \\in R$$, then $$(b, a) \\in R$$ also.</p>\n\n<p>Since we are looking for relations that are reflexive and transitive but <em>not</em> symmetric, we will need to include certain elements and exclude others.</p>\n\n<p>First, for the relation to be reflexive on the set $$\\{1,2,3\\}$$, it must contain $$(1,1), (2,2),$$ and $$(3,3)$$.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the relation must contain $$(1,2)$$ and $$(2,3)$$ and be transitive, it must also contain $$(1,3)$$ because if $$(1,2)$$ and $$(2,3)$$ are included, then to maintain transitivity, $$(1,3)$$ must be included as well.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the must-have elements of the desired relation are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For reflexivity: $$(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)$$</li>\n<br/><li>Given in the problem: $$(1,2), (2,3)$$</li>\n<br/><li>For transitivity (induced by given elements): $$(1,3)$$</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\"To maintain a relation that is reflexive, transitive, and not symmetric, we must carefully select additional pairs beyond the reflexive minimum $(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)$, and the given $(1,2), (2,3)$, which also necessitates $(1,3)$ due to transitivity. While including pairs such as $(2,1)$, $(3,1)$, or $(3,2)$ could potentially introduce symmetry, we can include some of these pairs as long as the resulting relation does not fulfill the condition for symmetry for all elements. This means we can include one or more of these pairs if doing so does not result in every pair being mirrored (i.e., for every $(a,b) \\in R$, $(b,a) \\in R$ is not required), thus keeping the relation not symmetric. The key is ensuring that the inclusion of any such pair does not lead to a situation where for every $(a,b)$ in the relation, the reverse $(b,a)$ also exists, which would make the relation symmetric, contradicting our requirement.\"</p>\n\n<br/>1.

In the case of $R_1$, for an arbitrary $a \\in \\mathbf{R}$, we need to check if $a R_1 a$ holds, which translates to checking if $a^2 + a^2 = 1$. This would mean $2a^2 = 1$ or $a^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since this is not true for every real number $a$, $R_1$ is not reflexive.</p>\n\n<p>Symmetry: A relation $R$ is symmetric if whenever $a R b$, then $b R a$. For $R_1$, if $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, then it is also true that $b^2 + a^2 = 1$. Thus, $R_1$ is symmetric.</p>\n\n<p>Transitivity: A relation $R$ is transitive if whenever $a R b$ and $b R c$, then $a R c$. For $R_1$, suppose $a R_1 b$ and $b R_1 c$, this means $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ and $b^2 + c^2 = 1$. However, if we add these two, we get $a^2 + 2b^2 + c^2 = 2$. There is no guarantee that $a^2 + c^2 = 1$. Therefore, $R_1$ is not transitive.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: Relation $R_1$ is not reflexive or transitive, and hence it is not an equivalence relation.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's consider $R_2$:</p>\n\n<p>Reflexivity: For any $(a, b) \\in \\mathbf{N} \\times \\mathbf{N}$, it's clear that $a + b = b + a$, which is just a reiteration of the commutative property of addition. Therefore, $(a, b) R_2 (a, b)$, and $R_2$ is reflexive.</p>\n\n<p>Symmetry: If $(a, b) R_2 (c, d)$, meaning $a + d = b + c$, then by reordering the terms we can similarly have $c + b = d + a$, which means $(c, d) R_2 (a, b)$, so $R_2$ is symmetric.</p>\n\n<p>Transitivity: Suppose $(a, b) R_2 (c, d)$ and $(c, d) R_2 (e, f)$, i.e., $a + d = b + c$ and $c + f = d + e$, we want to show that $(a, b) R_2 (e, f)$. Adding the two equations, we get $a + d + c + f = b + c + d + e$. By rearranging and simplifying, we get $a + f = b + e$, thus, $(a, b) R_2 (e, f)$.</p>\n\n<p>So $R_2$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, and therefore it is an equivalence relation.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: According to the above examination, only $R_2$ is an equivalence relation. Thus, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p>Option C: Only $R_2$ is an equivalence relation.</p>"

                            "explanation": "<p>To evaluate the relation $ R $ on the set $ A = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} $, we first need to understand the conditions for an element $(x, y)$ to be in $ R $. Specifically, $(x, y) \\in R$ if and only if $\\max\\{x, y\\} \\in \\{3, 4\\}$.</p>\n<p>Considering this, let's list the pairs:</p>\n\n<p><p>For $\\max\\{x, y\\} = 3$, the possible pairs are:</p></p>\n<p><p>$(0, 3), (3, 0), (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)$</p></p>\n<p><p>For $\\max\\{x, y\\} = 4$, the possible pairs are:</p></p>\n<p><p>$(0, 4), (4, 0), (1, 4), (4, 1), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)$</p></p>\n\n<p>Combining these, the set $ R $ consists of the following elements:</p>\n<p>$  R = \\{(0, 3), (3, 0), (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (0, 4), (4, 0), (1, 4), (4, 1), (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)\\}  $</p>\n<p>This gives us a total of 16 elements in $ R $, not 18 as initially claimed in statement $ S_1 $.</p>\n<p>Next, we analyze the properties of the relation $ R $:</p>\n\n<p><p><strong>Reflexivity</strong>: A relation is reflexive if $(x, x) \\in R$ for all $ x \\in A$. For example, $(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)$ are not in $ R $, so $ R $ is not reflexive.</p></p>\n<p><p><strong>Symmetry</strong>: A relation is symmetric if whenever $(a, b) \\in R$, then $(b, a) \\in R$ as well. For all pairs $(x, y)$ listed, both $(x, y)$ and $(y, x)$ are present. Thus, $ R $ is symmetric.</p></p>\n<p><p><strong>Transitivity</strong>: A relation is transitive if whenever $(a, b) \\in R$ and $(b, c) \\in R$, then $(a, c) \\in R$. An example where transitivity fails is $(0, 3)$ and $(3, 1)$ are in $ R $ but $(0, 1)$ is not in $ R$. Therefore, $ R $ is not transitive.</p></p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, statement $ S_2 $ is correct as $ R $ is symmetric but neither reflexive nor transitive.</p>"
