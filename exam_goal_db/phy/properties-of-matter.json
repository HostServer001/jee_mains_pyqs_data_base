Since the linear dimension changes by a factor of 9, the volume (and hence the mass) changes by a factor of:</p>\n\n<p>$$ 9^3 = 729 $$</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the weight (force due to gravity) also increases by a factor of 729.</p>\n\n<p>The cross-sectional area of the leg is proportional to the square of the linear dimensions. Thus, if the linear dimension increases by a factor of 9, the cross-sectional area increases by a factor of:</p>\n\n<p>$$ 9^2 = 81 $$</p>\n\n<p>Now, substituting these factors into the stress formula:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\text{New Stress} = \\dfrac{\\text{New Force}}{\\text{New Area}} = \\dfrac{729 \\times \\text{Original Force}}{81 \\times \\text{Original Area}} $$</p>\n\n<p>Simplifying, we get:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\text{New Stress} = 9 \\times \\dfrac{\\text{Original Force}}{\\text{Original Area}} = 9 \\times \\text{Original Stress} $$</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the stress in the leg increases by a factor of 9. Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p>Option B: 9</p>"

When these droplets coalesce, they form a single droplet with a larger radius R. The volume of the new droplet should be equal to the total volume of the 8 smaller droplets.\n<br/><br/>\nUsing the volume formula for spheres, we can write the relationship between the radii as:\n<br/><br/>\n$$\n8 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3\n$$\n<br/><br/>\nSolving for R, we get:\n<br/><br/>\n$$\nR = 2r\n$$\n<br/><br/>\nNow, we can use the relationship between the terminal velocities and radii of the droplets:\n<br/><br/>\n$$\n\\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\n$$\n<br/><br/>\nGiven the initial terminal velocity of 10 cm/s for the smaller droplets ($v_1$) and the relationship between r and R:\n<br/><br/>\n$$\n\\frac{10}{v_2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\n<br/><br/>\nSolving for the new terminal velocity ($v_2$):\n<br/><br/>\n$$\nv_2 = 40 \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n<br/><br/>\nThe new terminal velocity after the droplets coalesce is 40 cm/s."

According to the principle of fluid statics, in a body of static fluid, the pressure is the same at all points at the same horizontal level. This is because the pressure at any point in a static fluid is determined by the weight of the fluid above it. Therefore, at any given level in the reservoir, the pressure is the same because the weight of the water above each point is the same.</p>\n<p><b>Statement II</b>: The pressure applied to enclosed water is transmitted in all directions equally.</p>\n<p>This statement is also true. It is a direct statement of Pascal&#39;s law, which states that any change in pressure applied at any point in a fluid in a closed system is transmitted undiminished to all points in the fluid and acts in all directions. </p>\n<p>Therefore, both Statement I and Statement II are true.</p>\n"

This is true because when you apply pressure on one end of the tube, the pressure is transmitted uniformly throughout the enclosed incompressible fluid (the toothpaste in this case) and eventually pushes the toothpaste out of the other end.</p>\n<p><b>Reason R</b> provides the definition of Pascal&#39;s principle: &quot;A change in the pressure applied to an enclosed incompressible fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and to the walls of its container.&quot; This principle is directly applicable to the situation described in Assertion A. When you squeeze the tube, you apply pressure on the toothpaste, and this pressure is transmitted uniformly to all parts of the toothpaste, causing it to be pushed out of the other end.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Option D is the correct choice as both Assertion A and Reason R are correct statements, and R is the correct explanation of A.</p>\n"

                            "explanation": "<p>The Young's modulus of elasticity, denoted as $E$, is a measure of the stiffness of a material. It defines the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (deformation) in a material in the linear (elastic) portion of the stress-strain curve. As temperature changes, the interatomic distances and bonding energies within a material also change, affecting its mechanical properties, including its elasticity.</p>\n\n<p>For most materials, as the temperature increases, the atoms within the material gain kinetic energy and vibrate more vigorously. This increased vibration results in a reduction of the forces between atoms, making it easier for the material to deform under a given load. Hence, generally, the Young's modulus $E$ decreases with increasing temperature because the material becomes softer and less stiff. Thus, the correct option here would be:</p>\n\n<p>Option C: decreases</p>\n\n<p>However, it should be noted that the exact relationship between temperature and Young's modulus can vary depending on the material type and its microstructure. While the general trend for metals and polymers is a decrease in Young's modulus with rising temperature, the rate of decrease and the temperature range over which this occurs can differ significantly between materials. Some advanced materials and composites may exhibit more complex behavior due to their unique properties.</p>"

                            "explanation": "<p>To solve this problem, we need to employ Bernoulli's equation, which is applied to describe the behavior of fluid flow. For a fluid in steady flow, the principle states that the sum of the pressure potential energy density, kinetic energy density, and the gravitational potential energy density has the same value at all points along a streamline. Since the plane is in level flight, we can ignore changes in gravitational potential energy. Bernoulli's equation can be written as:</p>\n\n<p>$$ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2, $$</p>\n\n<p>where,</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>$P_1$ and $P_2$ are the static pressures on the lower and upper surfaces of the wing respectively,</li>\n\n<li>$v_1$ is the airspeed over the lower surface of the wing,</li>\n\n<li>$v_2$ is the airspeed over the upper surface of the wing,</li>\n\n<li>$\\rho$ is the density of air,</li>\n\n<li>$P_2 > P_1$ because $v_2 > v_1$.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>First, let's convert the airspeeds to $ \\mathrm{m/s} $:</p>\n\n<p>$$ v_1 = 180 \\frac{\\mathrm{km}}{\\mathrm{h}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\mathrm{m}}{3600 \\mathrm{s}} = 50 \\mathrm{m/s}, $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ v_2 = 252 \\frac{\\mathrm{km}}{\\mathrm{h}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\mathrm{m}}{3600 \\mathrm{s}} = 70 \\mathrm{m/s}. $$</p>\n\n<p>The pressure difference between the lower and upper wing surfaces can thus be calculated using Bernoulli's equation:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\Delta P = P_1 - P_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2. $$</p>\n\n<p>Substitute the values (with $\\rho = 1 \\mathrm{~kg/m}^3$):</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2} (1 \\mathrm{~kg/m}^3) (70 \\mathrm{m/s})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} (1 \\mathrm{~kg/m}^3) (50 \\mathrm{m/s})^2, $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2} (4900 \\mathrm{~kg/m \\cdot s}^2) - \\frac{1}{2} (2500 \\mathrm{~kg/m \\cdot s}^2), $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2} (2400 \\mathrm{~kg/m \\cdot s}^2), $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\Delta P = 1200 \\mathrm{~N/m}^2. $$</p>\n\n<p>The lift force generated by the pressure difference over one wing is $ \\Delta P \\times \\text{wing area} $, and since there are two wings, we must double the lift force generated by one wing to find the total lift force sustaining the plane. The weight of the plane is effectively the lift force when in level flight at constant speed. So:</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\text{Lift} = 2 \\times \\Delta P \\times \\text{wing area}, $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\text{Lift} = 2 \\times 1200 \\mathrm{~N/m}^2 \\times 40 \\mathrm{~m}^2, $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\text{Lift} = 2 \\times 48000 \\mathrm{N}, $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ \\text{Lift} = 96000 \\mathrm{N}. $$</p>\n\n<p>To find the mass $m$ of the plane, we use Newton's second law, where lift force is equal to the weight ($ mg $, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity):</p>\n\n<p>$$ m g = \\text{Lift}, $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ m = \\frac{\\text{Lift}}{g}, $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ m = \\frac{96000 \\mathrm{N}}{10 \\mathrm{m/s}^2}, $$</p>\n\n<p>$$ m = 9600 \\mathrm{kg}. $$</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the mass of the plane is 9600 kg.</p>"

                            "explanation": "<p>The statement given as Assertion (A) is indeed true. Elasticity is a physical property of a material whereby it can restore it to its original shape or size after deformation (stretching, compressing, or twisting) provided the deformation is within the material's elastic limit. Once the external force is removed, an elastic material will return to its initial state due to its intrinsic property. So, we can affirm the validity of Assertion (A).</p>\n\n<p>The statement labelled as Reason (R) is also true. When a material is deformed due to an applied external force, the molecules within the material are displaced from their equilibrium positions. The intermolecular and interatomic forces create a restoring force that attempts to bring the molecules back to their original, or equilibrium, positions. This restoring force is what allows the material to regain its shape when the external force is removed, assuming the material has not been deformed beyond its elastic limit. Hence, the restoring force indeed depends on the bonded interatomic and intermolecular forces within a solid.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Reason (R) is not just a true statement in isolation, but it is the correct explanation for Assertion (A). The reason that a material exhibits elasticity (Assertion A) is directly tied to the nature of the restoring force (Reason R), which is a result of the bonded interatomic and intermolecular forces within the material. Without these restoring forces, the material would not be able to return to its original shape, and thus would not exhibit elasticity.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer to the given question is:</p>\nOption C\nBoth (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)"

For the sphere to just float on water, the weight of the water displaced by the sphere must be equal to the weight of the sphere. The volume of water displaced by the sphere is equivalent to the outer volume of the sphere minus the volume of the cavity inside it.</p>\n\n<p>The volume of a sphere is given by $$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. For the given sphere, its outer radius is $$R = \\frac{D}{2}$$, and the radius of the cavity is $$r = \\frac{d}{2}$$. Therefore, the volume of the sphere excluding the cavity is:</p>\n\n<p>$$V_{\\text{solid part}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$</p>\n\n<p>$$V_{\\text{solid part}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^3 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^3$$</p>\n\n<p>Relative density ($\\sigma$) is defined as the ratio of the density of an object to the density of water. This means the actual density of the sphere is $\\sigma \\times \\text{density of water}$. Since the object just floats, the weight of the displaced water is equal to the weight of the solid part of the sphere (ignoring the cavity), which can be mathematically represented as:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\text{Weight of solid part} = \\text{Weight of displaced water}$$</p>\n\n<p>$$\\sigma \\cdot \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot V_{\\text{solid part}} \\cdot g = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot V_{\\text{displaced water}} \\cdot g$$</p>\n\n<p>Since the sphere is floating, $V_{\\text{displaced water}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$, the equation simplifies to:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\sigma \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$$</p>\n\n<p>Cancelling out common terms gives:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\sigma (R^3 - r^3) = R^3$$</p>\n\n<p>Given that $\\sigma$ is the relative density, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio of $D/d$ or equivalently $R/r$:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\sigma = \\frac{R^3}{R^3 - r^3}$$</p>\n\n<p>Solving for $R/r$:</p>\n\n<p>$$R^3 (1 - \\sigma) + \\sigma r^3 = 0$$</p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{R^3}{r^3} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma - 1}$$</p>\n\n<p>Since $R = \\frac{D}{2}$ and $r = \\frac{d}{2}$, the ratio of $D/d$ is equal to the ratio of $R/r$, thus:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{D}{d} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma - 1}\\right)^{1/3}$$</p>\n\n<p>This matches Option D:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma-1}\\right)^{1 / 3}$$</p>"

Mathematically, Hooke's law is given by:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ F = k \\cdot \\Delta x $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>$$F$$ is the force exerted by the spring.</li>\n\n<li>$$k$$ is the spring constant (a measure of the stiffness of the spring).</li>\n\n<li>$$\\Delta x$$ is the displacement from the natural length.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's denote the natural (unstretched) length of the spring as $$l_0$$. Given that the spring's length is $$a$$ under a tension of $$3 \\mathrm{~N}$$, and its length is $$b$$ under a tension of $$2 \\mathrm{~N}$$, we can write the equations as:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ 3 \\mathrm{~N} = k \\cdot (a - l_0) $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ 2 \\mathrm{~N} = k \\cdot (b - l_0) $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Next, we need to find the length displacement $$(3a - 2b)$$ in terms of the natural length $$l_0$$. We express the displacements as:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ x = (3a - 2b) - l_0 $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>To solve for this, let's express $$a - l_0$$ and $$b - l_0$$ from the given conditions:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ a - l_0 = \\frac{3 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ b - l_0 = \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Substitute these into the displacement equation:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ x = (3a - 2b) - l_0 = 3 \\left( \\frac{3 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} + l_0 \\right) - 2 \\left( \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} + l_0 \\right) - l_0 $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>On simplifying, we get:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ x = 3 \\frac{3 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} + 3 l_0 - 2 \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} - 2 l_0 - l_0 $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ x = \\frac{9 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} + 3 l_0 - \\frac{4 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} - 3 l_0 $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ x = \\frac{5 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Finally, by Hooke's Law, the force corresponding to this displacement is:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n<p>$$ F = k \\cdot x = k \\cdot \\frac{5 \\mathrm{~N}}{k} = 5 \\mathrm{~N} $$</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the tension required for the elastic spring's length $$(3a - 2b)$$ is <strong>5 N</strong>.</p>"

Here's an explanation for both statements:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement I: True</strong></p>\n\n<p>The contact angle between a solid and a liquid is indeed a measure of the wettability of the solid surface by the liquid. The contact angle is determined by the nature of both the solid and the liquid. It is a function of the interfacial tensions between solid-liquid ($ \\gamma_{\\text{SL}} $), solid-vapor ($ \\gamma_{\\text{SV}} $), and liquid-vapor ($ \\gamma_{\\text{LV}} $). This relationship can be understood through Young's equation:</p>\n\n<p>$ \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\text{SV}} - \\gamma_{\\text{SL}}}{\\gamma_{\\text{LV}}} $</p>\n\n<p>Where $ \\theta $ is the contact angle. Therefore, since the interfacial tensions vary with the materials in contact, the contact angle is indeed a property of the materials of both the solid and the liquid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement II: False</strong></p>\n\n<p>The rise of a liquid in a capillary tube is strongly dependent on the inner radius of the tube. This relationship is described by the Jurin's Law, which states the height ($ h $) to which a liquid will rise (or fall) in a capillary tube is inversely proportional to the radius ($ r $) of the tube, among other factors. The law is given by:</p>\n\n<p>$ h = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos \\theta}{\\rho g r} $</p>\n\n<p>Where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>$ \\gamma $ is the liquid-air surface tension,</li>\n\n<li>$ \\theta $ is the contact angle,</li>\n\n<li>$ \\rho $ is the density of the liquid,</li>\n\n<li>$ g $ is the acceleration due to gravity,</li>\n\n<li>$ r $ is the radius of the capillary tube.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>As seen from the equation, $ h $ is inversely proportional to $ r $. Therefore, the rise of the liquid indeed depends on the inner radius of the tube, making Statement II false.</p>"

Let's break down each statement for clarity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement I:</strong> When a capillary tube is dipped into a liquid and the liquid neither rises nor falls in the capillary, it suggests a scenario where the adhesive forces (between the liquid and the solid) and the cohesive forces (among the liquid molecules) are in perfect balance. The contact angle, which is the angle formed by the tangent to the liquid surface at the point of contact with the wall of the tube, plays a crucial role here. A contact angle of $$0^{\\circ}$$ implies complete wetting, meaning the liquid spreads out to maximize contact with the solid. However, the statement that the liquid neither rises nor falls specifically with a contact angle of $$0^{\\circ}$$ seems inaccurate. In reality, when the contact angle is $$0^{\\circ}$$, it denotes perfect wetting, and the liquid tends to rise in the capillary tube. Thus, the precision of Statement I could be disputed based on the typical behavior of liquids in the context of capillarity and contact angles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Statement II:</strong> The contact angle really is a property of both the solid and the liquid. It depends on the nature of the solid surface (whether it's hydrophilic or hydrophobic) and the type of liquid. This is because the contact angle reflects the degree of interaction between the liquid and solid surfaces, which is influenced by characteristics such as surface tension of the liquid and the surface energies of both the liquid and solid. Thus, Statement II accurately describes the nature of the contact angle as being dependent on both the material of the solid and the liquid.</p>\n\n<p>Considering the analysis above:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Statement I suggests a specific scenario that does not align accurately with the principles of capillarity and wettability, particularly at a contact angle of $$0^{\\circ}$$, which typically would result in the liquid rising in the capillary, not staying neutral.</li>\n\n<li>Statement II accurately reflects the factors influencing the contact angle between a liquid and a solid surface.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct option based on the given statements and their analysis would be:</p>\n\n<p>Option B: Statement I is false but Statement II is true.</p>"

It is given as:\n\n<p>$ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} $</p>\n\n<p>where $F$ is the breaking force and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

The weight of an object is given by:</p>\n\n<p>$ W = mg $</p>\n\n<p>where $m$ is the mass of the object and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the wire's mass, $m$, can also be expressed in terms of its density ($\\rho$), length ($L$), and area ($A$) as:</p>\n\n<p>$ m = \\rho V = \\rho A L $</p>\n\n<p>We can substitute this expression in the equation for weight:</p>\n\n<p>$ W = \\rho A L g $</p>\n\n<p>On a planet where the acceleration due to gravity is $\\frac{1}{3}$rd of that on Earth, we substitute $g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{1}{3}g_{\\text{Earth}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 10 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = \\frac{10}{3} \\, \\text{m/s}^2$. The breaking force $F$ which is equivalent to the weight at the breaking point, is therefore given by:</p>\n\n<p>$ F = \\rho A L g_{\\text{planet}} $</p>\n\n<p>Since the breaking stress $\\sigma$ is also $F/A$, we can set the two expressions equal to find the maximum length $L$ of the wire before breaking:</p>\n\n<p>$ \\sigma = \\frac{\\rho A L g_{\\text{planet}}}{A} $</p>\n\n<p>$ \\sigma = \\rho L g_{\\text{planet}} $</p>\n\n<p>Solving for $L$:</p>\n\n<p>$ L = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\rho g_{\\text{planet}}} $</p>\n\n<p>Given that $\\sigma = 1.2 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{N/m}^2$, $\\rho = 6 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$, and $g_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{10}{3} \\, \\text{m/s}^2$, we can substitute these values into the formula:</p>\n\n<p>$ L = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^8}{6 \\times 10^4 \\times \\left( \\frac{10}{3} \\right) } $</p>\n\n<p>$ L = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^8}{2 \\times 10^5} $</p>\n\n<p>$ L = 600 \\, \\text{m} $</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the maximum length of the wire that can be suspended from a rigid support on this planet without breaking is $600$ meters.</p></p>"

A force that restores an elastic body of unit area to its original state:</strong> This definition describes <strong>Stress</strong>, as stress is the force applied over a unit area of a material that results in a deformation. Stress is involved in restoring the body to its original state.</li>\n\n<li><strong>B. Two equal and opposite forces parallel to opposite faces:</strong> This is a description of <strong>Shear Modulus (also known as Modulus of Rigidity)</strong>, which measures the material's response to shear stress (like forces applied parallel to one of its faces).</li>\n\n<li><strong>C. Forces perpendicular everywhere to the surface per unit area same everywhere:</strong> This definition resembles the concept of <strong>Bulk Modulus</strong>, which is concerned with uniform pressure applied in all directions at points on the surface of a body and relates to volume change.</li>\n\n<li><strong>D. Two equal and opposite forces perpendicular to opposite faces:</strong> This describes <strong>Young's Modulus (also known as Modulus of Elasticity)</strong>, which involves tensile stress (force applied perpendicularly) leading to changes in length of a material.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Therefore, matching the lists results in the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>(A)-(III), because stress is the general concept applicable to the force per unit area described in restoring the body to its original state.</li>\n\n<li>(B)-(IV), because shear modulus is specifically related to parallel forces applied on opposite faces.</li>\n\n<li>(C)-(I), because bulk modulus deals with situations where force is applied uniformly over the surface of an object, affecting its volume.</li>\n\n<li>(D)-(II), because Young's modulus applies to forces perpendicular to the faces, affecting the length of a material.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hence, the correct option is <strong>Option B (A)-(III), (B)-(IV), (C)-(I), (D)-(II)</strong>.</p>"

This difference in pressure can be calculated using the formula that relates the surface tension of the soap bubble to the radius of the bubble. The correct formula for the pressure difference ($$\\Delta P$$) across a soap bubble is given by:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\Delta P = \\frac{4 S}{R}$$</p>\n\n<p>Here, $$S$$ is the surface tension of the bubble and $$R$$ is the radius of the bubble. The factor of 4 comes from the fact that a soap bubble has two surfaces (an inner and an outer surface), and for each surface, the Laplace pressure (which contributes to the pressure difference due to surface tension) is given by $$\\frac{2S}{R}$$. Thus, for two surfaces, you double this amount, resulting in the $$\\frac{4 S}{R}$$ term.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is:</p>\n\n<p>Option B</p>\n\n<p>$$\\frac{4 \\mathrm{~S}}{\\mathrm{R}}$$</p>"

                            "explanation": "<p>(A) Surface tension arises due to the extra potential energy of the molecules at the surface of a liquid compared to the molecules in the interior.</p>\n<p>(B) When a liquid is heated, the kinetic energy of it molecules increases, causing them to move more freely and overcome the intermolecular forces that contribute to viscosity, thus lowering it.</p>\n<p>(C) Higher temperature in gas means faster moving molecules, resulting in more collisions and therefore an increase in viscosity.</p>\n<p>(D) Reynold's number $$ = {{Inertial\\,force} \\over {Visous\\,force}}$$</p>\n<p>$${R_e} = {{\\rho VD} \\over \\mu }$$,</p>\n<p>v = velocity of flow</p>\n<p>D = Diameter of pipe</p>\n<p>If, $R_e < 2000$, flow is laminar flow</p>\n<p>$2000 < R_e < 3000 \\Rightarrow$ transition region</p>\n<p>$R_e > 3000 \\Rightarrow$ turbulant flow.</p>\n<p>(E) Tangent at a point to the streamline gives the direction of net velocity of the flow. If the two streamlines intersect each other. It signifies two directions of velocity which cannot be possible. Thus, two streamlines cannot intersect each other. Hence, option 2 is correct.</p>"
