For example, consider two equal mass particles moving with the same speed but in opposite directions. The linear momentum of the system will be zero because momentum is a vector quantity and the two momenta will cancel out. However, kinetic energy is a scalar quantity and does not cancel out in this way. Each particle has kinetic energy due to its motion, so the total kinetic energy of the system is not zero.</p>\n<p>Statement $$B:$$ The kinetic energy of a system of particles being zero also does not imply that the linear momentum is zero. If the kinetic energy is zero, it means that all the particles are at rest (since kinetic energy is associated with motion). However, the linear momentum will also be zero in this case because momentum depends on both mass and velocity, and the velocity of each particle is zero. </p>\n<p>But remember that zero linear momentum doesn&#39;t exclusively mean all particles are at rest. As explained above, it could be the scenario where particles have equal and opposite momenta, thereby cancelling each other. Hence, $$B$$ doesn&#39;t imply $$A$$.</p>\n<p>So, neither statement implies the other. Hence, Option A is correct.</p>\n"

                            "explanation": "First, we need to find the velocity of the gun after the bullet is fired. We can use conservation of momentum to do this. The total momentum of the system of the gun and bullet is conserved before and after the bullet is fired. Therefore, we can write\n<br/><br/>\n$$m_g u_g + m_b u_b = m_g v_g + m_b v_b$$\n<br/><br/>\nwhere $$u_g = 0$$ is the initial velocity of the gun, $$u_b = 600 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$ is the initial velocity of the bullet, $$m_g = 3 \\mathrm{~kg}$$ is the mass of the gun, $$m_b = 0.01 \\mathrm{~kg}$$ is the mass of the bullet, $$v_b = 0$$ is the final velocity of the bullet (since it has left the gun), and $$v_g$$ is the final velocity of the gun.\n<br/><br/>\nSubstituting the given values, we get\n<br/><br/>\n$$(3 \\mathrm{~kg})(0) + (0.01 \\mathrm{~kg})(600 \\mathrm{~m/s}) = (3 \\mathrm{~kg})v_g + (0.01 \\mathrm{~kg})(0)$$\n<br/><br/>\nSolving for $$v_g$$, we get\n<br/><br/>\n$$v_g = \\frac{0.01 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 600 \\mathrm{~m/s}}{3 \\mathrm{~kg}} = 2 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$\n<br/><br/>\nTherefore, the velocity of the gun after the bullet is fired is $$v_g = 2 \\mathrm{~m/s}$$.\n<br/><br/>\nNext, we need to find the impulse on the gun. The impulse-momentum theorem states that the impulse on an object is equal to the change in momentum of that object. Therefore, the impulse on the gun is given by\n<br/><br/>\n$$I = \\Delta p = m_g \\Delta v$$\n<br/><br/>\nwhere $$\\Delta v = v_f - u_g$$ is the change in velocity of the gun. Since the initial velocity of the gun is zero, we can write $$\\Delta v = v_g$$.\n<br/><br/>\nSubstituting the given values, we get\n<br/><br/>\n$$I = (3 \\mathrm{~kg}) \\times (2 \\mathrm{~m/s}) = 6 \\mathrm{~Ns}$$\n<br/><br/>\nTherefore, the impulse on the gun is $$6 \\mathrm{~Ns}$$, which is the correct answer."

Calculations:</strong>\n\n<p>Since all spheres have mass $2M$, we can simplify the COM calculations:</p>\n\n<p>$$X_{COM} = \\frac{2M \\cdot 4 + 2M \\cdot 0 + 2M \\cdot 0} {2M + 2M + 2M} = \\frac{4}{3}$$</p>\n\n<p>$$Y_{COM} = \\frac{2M \\cdot 0 + 2M \\cdot 4 + 2M \\cdot 0} {2M + 2M + 2M} = \\frac{4}{3}$$</p>\n\n<strong>4.

Its magnitude is:</p>\n\n<p>$$|\\vec{r}_{COM}| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}$$</p>\n\n<strong>5. Finding x:</strong>\n\n<p>We are given that the magnitude of the position vector is of the form $\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{x}$.

                            "explanation": "<p>To solve this problem, we can make use of the concept of center of mass. The center of mass (CM) of a system remains unchanged if the internal forces act within the system without any external force. When one mass moves toward the CM, to keep the CM at the same position, the other mass must move in a way that the product of each mass with its displacement relative to the CM remains constant.</p>\n\n<p>The formula to ensure that the center of mass remains unchanged can be derived from the principle of conservation of momentum or simply by understanding that the weighted average position (considering masses as weights) does not change.</p>\n\n<p>Let's denote:\n- $$x_1$$ as the distance moved by $$m_1$$ towards the CM,\n- $$x_2$$ as the distance $$m_2$$ needs to move towards the CM,\n- The total mass of the system as $$M = m_1 + m_2$$.</p>\n\n<p>Since $$m_1$$ moves towards the CM by 2 cm, we apply the principle that the weighted sum of displacements (taking mass into account) remains 0 to maintain the center of mass at its original position:</p>\n\n<p>$$m_1 \\cdot x_1 + m_2 \\cdot x_2 = 0$$</p>\n\n<p>Given that $$m_1 = 3 \\, \\text{kg}$$, $$m_2 = 2 \\, \\text{kg}$$, and $$x_1 = 2 \\, \\text{cm}$$, we substitute these values into the equation:</p>\n\n<p>$$3 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot x_2 = 0$$</p>\n\n<p>Solving for $$x_2$$ gives:</p>\n\n<p>$$6 + 2x_2 = 0$$</p>\n\n<p>$$2x_2 = -6$$</p>\n\n<p>$$x_2 = -3 \\, \\text{cm}$$</p>\n\n<p>This means the mass $$m_2$$ should move $$3 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$$ towards the center of mass to keep the center of mass of the system at the original position. The negative sign indicates the direction is towards the center of mass, similar to $$m_1$$'s movement direction in relation to keeping the CM stationary.</p>"

Its mass (or weight) is proportional to its area:</p>\n<p>$$M = \\pi \\times 20^2 = 400\\pi.$$</p></p>\n<p><p>A hole of radius 5 cm is cut out. Similarly, its mass (if it were a complete disc) would be:</p>\n<p>$$m = \\pi \\times 5^2 = 25\\pi.$$</p></p>\n<p><p>Since the hole cuts through the disc, we treat it as having a negative mass. The center of the original disc is at the origin (0,0), and we need to locate the center of the hole.</p></p>\n<p><p>The problem states that the edge of the hole touches the edge of the disc. This means that the distance between the centre of the hole and the centre of the large disc is:</p>\n<p>$$20 \\text{ cm (disc radius)} - 5 \\text{ cm (hole radius)} = 15 \\text{ cm}.$$</p>\n<p>For convenience, we can assume that the hole is positioned along the positive x-axis. Thus, the centre of the hole is at:</p>\n<p>$$\\vec{r}_\\text{hole} = (15, 0).$$</p></p>\n<p><p>Now, the centre of mass (COM) of the remaining shape (the disc with the hole) can be calculated using the idea of superposition:</p>\n<p>$$\\vec{R}_{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{M \\cdot \\vec{r}_\\text{disc} - m \\cdot \\vec{r}_\\text{hole}}{M - m}.$$</p>\n<p>Here, $\\vec{r}_\\text{disc} = (0,0)$ (since the large disc is centered at the origin).</p></p>\n<p><p>Plug in the values:</p>\n<p>$$\\vec{R}_{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{400\\pi \\cdot (0,0) - 25\\pi \\cdot (15,0)}{400\\pi - 25\\pi}     = \\frac{-(25\\pi)(15,0)}{375\\pi}    = \\frac{-375\\pi \\cdot (1,0)}{375\\pi}    = (-1,0).$$</p></p>\n<p><p>This tells us that the centre of mass of the remaining piece is 1 cm from the origin, along the negative x-axis.</p></p>\n\n<p>Thus, the distance of the centre of mass from the origin is:</p>\n<p>$$\\boxed{1.0\\text{ cm}}.$$</p>\n<p>So, the correct answer is Option D.</p>"

                            "explanation": "<p>To solve this problem, we start by using the conservation of linear momentum. </p>\n<p>Initially, block A of mass $ m_1 = 10 \\, \\text{kg} $ is moving with velocity $ v_1 = 3 \\, \\text{m/s} $, while block B of mass $ m_2 = 5 \\, \\text{kg} $ is at rest. The blocks move together after the collision. The final velocity of the system is $ v_{\\text{cm}} $. Applying the conservation of linear momentum, we have:</p>\n<p>$ m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_{\\text{cm}} $</p>\n<p>Substituting the known values:</p>\n<p>$ 10 \\times 3 + 5 \\times 0 = (10 + 5) v_{\\text{cm}} $</p>\n<p>$ 30 = 15 v_{\\text{cm}} $</p>\n<p>Solving for $ v_{\\text{cm}} $:</p>\n<p>$ v_{\\text{cm}} = \\frac{30}{15} = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} $</p>\n<p>Next, we use the conservation of energy to find the compression in the spring. The initial kinetic energy of block A is given by:</p>\n<p>$ \\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 3^2 = 45 \\, \\text{J} $</p>\n<p>The final kinetic energy of both blocks moving together at $ v_{\\text{cm}} = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} $ is:</p>\n<p>$ \\frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_{\\text{cm}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15 \\times 2^2 = 30 \\, \\text{J} $</p>\n<p>The difference in kinetic energy is the energy stored in the compressed spring:</p>\n<p>$ \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 = 45 - 30 = 15 \\, \\text{J} $</p>\n<p>Substituting the given spring constant $ k = 3000 \\, \\text{N/m} $ into the energy equation:</p>\n<p>$ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3000 \\times x^2 = 15 $</p>\n<p>$ 1500 x^2 = 15 $</p>\n<p>Solving for $ x^2 $:</p>\n<p>$ x^2 = \\frac{15}{1500} = \\frac{1}{100} $</p>\n<p>Finally, solving for $ x $:</p>\n<p>$ x = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \\, \\text{m} $</p>\n<p>Therefore, the compression in the spring is $ 0.1 \\, \\text{m} $.</p>"
